"70 ContributorsLove Will Tear Us Apart Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhen routine bites hard and ambitions are low\nAnd resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow\nAnd we're changing our ways, taking different roads\n\n[Chorus]\nThen love, love will tear us apart again\nLove, love will tear us apart again\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side\nIs my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry\nYet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives\n\n[Chorus]\nBut love, love will tear us apart again\nLove, love will tear us apart again\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed\nThere's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold\nJust that something so good, just can't function no more\n\n[Chorus]\nThen love, love will tear us apart again\nLove, love will tear us apart again\nThen love, love will tear it apart again\nLove, love will tear it apart againYou might also like86Embed"
