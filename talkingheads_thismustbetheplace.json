"79 ContributorsThis Must Be the Place (Naive Melody) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHome is where I want to be\nPick me up and turn me around\nI feel numb, born with a weak heart\nI guess I must be having fun\nThe less we say about it, the better\nWe'll make it up as we go along\nFeet on the ground, head in the sky\nIt's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing\n\n[Chorus 1]\nHi-yeah, I got plenty of time\nHi-yeah, you got light in your eyes\nAnd you're standing here beside me\nI love the passing of time\nNever for money, always for love\nCover up and say goodnight, say goodnight\n\n[Verse 2]\nHome is where I want to be\nBut I guess I'm already there\nI come home, she lifted up her wings\nI guess that this must be the place\nI can't tell one from another\nDid I find you or you find me?\nThere was a time before we were born\nIf someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be\nYou might also like[Chorus 2]\nHi-yeah, we drift in and out\nHi-yeah, sing into my mouth\nOut of all those kinds of people\nYou got a face with a view\nI'm just an animal looking for a home and\nShare the same space for a minute or two\nAnd you love me 'til my heart stops\nLove me 'til I'm dead\nEyes that light up, eyes look through you\nCover up the blank spots, hit me on the head, I go\nOoh52Embed"
